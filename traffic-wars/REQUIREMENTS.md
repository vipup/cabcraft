# ðŸš— Traffic Simulator - Project Requirements

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
A **ride-sharing simulator** in the style of classic Warcraft RTS games, where riders request rides and drivers compete to complete them in a city environment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Requirements

### 1. Game Concept
- **Primary Genre**: Ride-sharing simulation (NOT combat RTS)
- **Style**: Warcraft-style RTS interface and layout
- **Setting**: City battlefield with streets and buildings
- **Main Roles**: Riders (customers) and Drivers (service providers)

### 2. Core Gameplay Loop
- âœ… **Riders** can spawn and request rides
- âœ… **Drivers** compete to take available rides
- âœ… **Ride completion** earns money and improves rating
- âœ… **Real-time simulation** with automatic ride requests

### 3. Visual Layout (Warcraft-Style)
- âœ… **Main battlefield** takes up most of the screen
- âœ… **Bottom HUD panel** with game controls and stats
- âœ… **Mini-map** in bottom-left corner showing world overview
- âœ… **Click-to-pan** functionality on mini-map
- âœ… **Real-size objects** in main view (1:1 scale)

### 4. City Environment
- âœ… **Visible streets** with road grid system
- âœ… **Building blocks** between roads
- âœ… **Landmarks** (Downtown, Airport, Mall, Station, Hospital, University)
- âœ… **Procedural generation** of city layout

### 5. Unit Management
- âœ… **Riders** (ðŸ‘¤) - Static, request rides, get picked up
- âœ… **Drivers** (ðŸš—) - Mobile, compete for rides, complete trips
- âœ… **Status tracking** (idle, going_to_rider, on_ride, waiting, in_ride)
- âœ… **Visual indicators** for ride requests (pickup/dropoff markers)

### 6. Ride System
- âœ… **Ride requests** with pickup and dropoff locations
- âœ… **Fare calculation** based on distance
- âœ… **Driver assignment** (closest available driver)
- âœ… **Movement system** with smooth tweening animations
- âœ… **Completion tracking** with earnings and rating updates

### 7. User Interface
- âœ… **Resource display** (Earnings, Rating, Active Rides)
- âœ… **Action buttons** (Spawn Rider, Spawn Driver, Request Ride)
- âœ… **Mini-map stats** (Time, Agents, Average Ride Duration)
- âœ… **Real-time updates** of all game metrics

### 8. Technical Implementation
- âœ… **Phaser.js 3.70** game framework
- âœ… **HTML5 Canvas** rendering
- âœ… **Responsive design** with window resize handling
- âœ… **Modular code structure** with clear separation of concerns

## ðŸŽ® Game Mechanics

### Ride Request Flow
1. **Spawn riders** using the "Spawn Rider" button
2. **Spawn drivers** using the "Spawn Driver" button  
3. **Request rides** using the "Request Ride" button
4. **Automatic assignment** to closest available driver
5. **Driver movement** to pickup location
6. **Rider pickup** and movement to dropoff
7. **Ride completion** with earnings and rating updates

### Scoring System
- **Earnings**: Money earned from completed rides
- **Rating**: Performance rating (0.0-5.0) based on ride completion time
- **Active Rides**: Current number of rides in progress

### World Navigation
- **Mini-map click**: Pan main camera to clicked world position
- **Smooth camera movement** with easing
- **World bounds**: 2400x1600 world size with camera constraints

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### File Structure
```
traffic-wars/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML with Warcraft-style layout
â”œâ”€â”€ game.js            # Core game logic and Phaser scene
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json       # Project configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # User documentation
â””â”€â”€ REQUIREMENTS.md    # This requirements document
```

### Key Classes and Methods
- **TrafficSimulator** (Phaser Scene)
  - `create()` - Initialize game world and systems
  - `createCityBackground()` - Generate city layout
  - `spawnRider()` / `spawnDriver()` - Unit creation
  - `createRideRequest()` - Ride request system
  - `moveDriverToPickup()` / `moveToDropoff()` - Movement logic
  - `completeRide()` - Ride completion handling
  - `renderMiniMap()` - Mini-map rendering
  - `centerCameraOn()` - Camera panning

### Data Structures
- **Unit Types**: Rider and Driver configurations
- **Ride Settings**: Fare calculation parameters
- **Game State**: Earnings, rating, active rides tracking
- **World Data**: Road positions, building locations, landmarks
