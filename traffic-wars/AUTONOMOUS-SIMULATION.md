# 🤖 Autonomous Simulation Feature

## Overview
The Traffic Simulator now includes a fully autonomous simulation mode that automatically creates and manages objects on the map without user intervention.

## 🎮 How to Use

### Activating Autonomous Mode
1. **Click the "🤖 Auto OFF" button** in the top navigation bar
2. The button will change to **"🤖 Auto ON"** with a pulsing red animation
3. The simulation will immediately start creating objects automatically

### Configuration Panel
When autonomous mode is active, a configuration panel appears in the top banner with three controls:

- **Riders**: Maximum number of riders to maintain (default: 20)
- **Drivers**: Maximum number of drivers to maintain (default: 15)  
- **Rides**: Maximum number of active rides at once (default: 10)

### Automatic Behaviors

#### 🏍️ Rider Spawning
- **Interval**: Every 3 seconds (adjustable by simulation speed)
- **Limit**: Respects the "Riders" configuration
- **Location**: Random positions within the current viewport
- **Behavior**: Riders wait for ride requests

#### 🚗 Driver Spawning  
- **Interval**: Every 5 seconds (adjustable by simulation speed)
- **Limit**: Respects the "Drivers" configuration
- **Types**: Random mix of ground (🚗) and air (✈️) drivers
- **Location**: Random positions within the current viewport
- **Behavior**: Drivers automatically accept and complete rides

#### 📱 Ride Request Creation
- **Interval**: Every 4 seconds (adjustable by simulation speed)
- **Limit**: Respects the "Rides" configuration
- **Types**: Random mix of ground and air rides (60% ground, 40% air)
- **Assignment**: Automatically assigns closest available driver of matching type
- **Pricing**: Distance-based fares (ground: $0.10/km, air: $0.15/km)

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Speed Integration
- All intervals are **automatically adjusted** based on the simulation speed slider
- Higher speed = faster spawning and more intense simulation
- Lower speed = slower, more relaxed simulation

### Smart Limits
- The system respects maximum limits to prevent overcrowding
- Automatically stops spawning when limits are reached
- Resumes spawning when objects are removed or completed

### Viewport Awareness
- All spawned objects appear within the current camera viewport
- Includes 50px padding from viewport edges for better visibility
- Objects spawn in visible areas for immediate user feedback

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. **Demo Mode**
- Perfect for showcasing the application
- Creates a lively, active simulation automatically
- No user interaction required

### 2. **Stress Testing**
- Test system performance with many objects
- Observe how the simulation handles high activity
- Monitor frame rates and responsiveness

### 3. **Background Simulation**
- Let the simulation run while working on other tasks
- Observe emergent behaviors and patterns
- Collect data on ride completion rates and earnings

### 4. **Development Testing**
- Automatically test new features with active simulation
- Verify that changes work under load
- Continuous testing without manual intervention

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### Button States
- **🤖 Auto OFF** (Green): Autonomous mode disabled
- **🤖 Auto ON** (Red, Pulsing): Autonomous mode active

### Configuration Panel
- Appears only when autonomous mode is active
- Compact design that doesn't interfere with other controls
- Real-time updates to simulation parameters

### Console Logging
- All autonomous actions are logged with appropriate log levels
- Easy to monitor what the system is doing
- Adjustable log level filtering

## 🔧 Configuration Options

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Riders | 20 | 1-50 | Maximum riders on map |
| Drivers | 15 | 1-30 | Maximum drivers on map |
| Rides | 10 | 1-20 | Maximum active rides |
| Spawn Intervals | 3-5s | Variable | Based on simulation speed |

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Fully Autonomous**: No user interaction required
2. **Configurable**: Adjust limits and behavior in real-time
3. **Performance Aware**: Respects system limits and viewport
4. **Speed Integrated**: Works with existing speed controls
5. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators and logging
6. **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't interfere with manual controls

## 🎮 Manual Override

Even in autonomous mode, users can still:
- Manually spawn riders and drivers
- Create ride requests manually
- Clean the map (stops autonomous spawning)
- Adjust simulation speed
- Use all other game features

The autonomous system works alongside manual controls, making it perfect for mixed interaction scenarios.
